# WIP: Greenhouse automation with the RPi and python
## Warning: the following Text is riddled with spelling errors. I'm writing this on mobile in my work breaks so there will be a lot of mistakes until I have the time to revisit and proof read properly.
My first attempt to automate a greenhouse with python. Starting small, I'll automate a seedling heat mat and I'm going to
expand the scope of the project as I'll progress.
